# RAS-A Pairing Protocol v2 code samples

**Note: this repository is a work in progress and pretends to provide an exemplification of the usage of the Connection Manager library as an implementation of the RAS-A Pairing v2 protocol. Providing these code samples, together with the JSON APIs and protocol sequences is considered enough to facilitate the implementation of the Pairing v2 protocol. Further details on the implementation can be provided according to the necessity.**

Code samples for facilitating the implementation of the RAS-A IOP Pairing Protocol. The provided samples leverage the Auterion Connection Manager library to implement Master and Slave examples of the Pairing Protocol. The library usage for these examples is mandatory, but doesn't mean that the developer cannot develop a pairing implementation (slave and/or master) to use with these samples - the samples provide context on how to use the library and how the pairing procedure can be implemented. The slave and master JSON API usage and sequence are documented on the RAS-A IOP document.

The above code examples are not integrated into a build system yet. Auterion is working on integration of connection manager library for these samples.
